# Predicting Survival in Patients with Hepatic Cirrhosis
This project investigates the use of machine learning models to predict survival in patients with hepatic cirrhosis based on clinical data. Developed by Núria Llopart as a second-year undergraduate project at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia, the work demonstrates the integration of data analysis, preprocessing, and model development to address real-world medical challenges.

## Overview
The goal of this project is to create a predictive model that classifies patients into survival categories:

- C: Survived.
- CL: Survived due to liver transplantation.
- D: Deceased.
By using clinical data with 20 features, the project highlights the application of machine learning techniques to improve decision-making in healthcare.

## Key Features
Comprehensive Data Analysis: In-depth exploration and preprocessing of clinical datasets.
Advanced Modeling: Includes methods such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Explainable Boosting Machines (EBM).
Dimensionality Reduction: Employs Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to optimize feature selection.
Class Imbalance Handling: Uses SMOTE to address imbalanced datasets for improved model accuracy.
Awards and Recognition
This project stands out for its excellence and innovation, earning multiple awards:

## Project Highlights
- Data Preparation: Includes cleaning, normalization, and encoding categorical variables.
- Exploratory Analysis: Examines relationships between features and the target variable to detect trends and outliers.
- Model Evaluation: Uses cross-validation techniques to assess model performance and mitigate overfitting.
- Interpretability: Focuses on creating transparent and explainable models suitable for clinical decision-making.
